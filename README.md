### About
-------------
This is my first true game made in GDScript. It's a simple clone of the Bejeweled. Nothing too ambitious. <br> 
I made this project to learn a bit about GDScript, and I guess for the first project it's alright? There's not too much to say about it to be honest, it's just Bejeweled. <br>

I did some small clean up and added comments but I haven't made any significant changes to the code. <br>
I uploaded this repo and preserved the game for me to look at how much I improve over time. Improving the code now, with my current knowledge defeats the point. <br>
However, you're free to improve upon this code if you wish to do so :)

### Getting Started
-------------
To compile this project, you will need at least Godot v3.5.1. Do not forget you will need the required export templates. <br> 
More in-depth guide is avaiable here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html <br>
You're free to modify the project as you wish.
